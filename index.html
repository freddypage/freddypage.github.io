							<p>Hi I’m Fred. I’m an undergraduate student completing my studies in Computer Science. Currently, I’m entering my third year at Mcgill University in the great city of Montreal. In recent years, society’s relationship with technology has changed, but I’ve always believed that making essential aspects of your life programmable can free up the clutter in our minds and our environment. My desire for the industry started at a young age. I was fascinated with the pace that video games were improving in realism and immersion. As a kid, it all seemed magical, and even more so the fact that this had all been done behind a desk, at a computer. Then I started flicking through a couple of editions of Wired and before I knew it I was hooked and ready to learn. My other interests lie in movie-binging, cooking and calisthenic fitness.</p>

						<h1>Eat Smart!</h1>
						<h5>A MEAN stack web app.</h5>
					</div>
					<p>Eat Smart is a full stack web app developed by me and three other team mates. The idea was to make an application that could help you better spend your money on tight budget, whether at home, or out looking for a meal at restaurant. The app was built to help learn the in's and out's of web development. 
					The project tested everything we knew, but became a labour of love
					that eventually grew into something we might use in our daily lives if we had a few spare dollars for maintenance. I personally developed the backend of the app, working with MongoDB, Espress and Node.js to handle
					API calls to the server.</p>

						<h1>Software Developer Intern at Iridian.</h1>
						<h5>Refurbishing analytical software.</h5>
					</div>
					<p>Over the Summer of 2018, I was accepted as an intern at Iridian Spectral Technologies, a thin film filter manufacturer based in Ottawa. I was tasked with rebuilding an old piece of software that was becoming outdated and slow. The project was really fun because I was allowed full creative control over software so long as it was functional. I worked in C# and Visual Studio which made it feel very similar to web development. Real time feedback from users at the company as well as the scope of the project forced me to design software with good principles. </p>

						<h1>Tech and Tools Summer Camp</h1>
						<h5>Teaching youths about tech.</h5>
					</div>
					<p>I volunteered for a few weeks at a summer internship program offered by my High School. I was really inspired to pursue Computer Science after my experiences at the camp. Some of the kids there were really proficient at coding the little arduino motors they were given, and what was more was that they were actually enjoying it. I thought the idea of learning CS and being able to share what I know to others would be so satisfying, especially as job. I could tell that this was the future.</p>
