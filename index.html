		<h1>In the summer of 2018 I had the pleasure of working with the folks at Iridian Spectral technologies. I developped internal applications for the company in Visual Studio to help improve efficiency and analysis of the manufacturing department. I worked in C#, XAML and SQL. My projects offered me a new perspective on responsible layouts, user friendly design and clean coding.</h1>
